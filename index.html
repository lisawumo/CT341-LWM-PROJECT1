          <p><b>A combination of playful sans-serif typefaces</b></p>
          <p>Press Start 2P is a bitmap font based on the font design from 1980s Namco arcade games. It works best at sizes of 8px, 16px and other multiples of 8. Although the design of uppercase letters and digits dates back to Atari's "Sprint" (1977), the specific glyph forms in this TrueType conversion are based on those from "Return of Ishtar" (1986), one of the first games to include and regularly use lowercase as well as uppercase letters in its screen font.
          </p>
          <p>Chakra Petch is a Thai and Latin family which features Thai's traditional looped letterforms. It's a square sans serif with tapered corners. Due to the design, it works well for both digital and print based media.</p>

          <p><b>A good combination of modern sans-serif typefaces</b></p>
          <p>Hind Madurai is a family of five Tamil fonts, which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. In addition to Tamil, the Hind Madurai fonts also include Latin-script characters.
            Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly mono-linear strokes. Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. Additionally, Hind’s letterforms feature open apertures and counter-forms. The entire family feels very legible when used to set text.
